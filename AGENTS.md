- create cucumber.js scenarios for each new feature
- use composable "Given" steps (small, reusable steps) instead of one-off setup steps
- make Given steps generic and expose actual file content/changes in scenario text — don't hide setup behind abstract step names
- inline setup logic into step definitions rather than chaining helpers; each step maps to one commit
- apply to both workflow.feature and sandbox.feature
