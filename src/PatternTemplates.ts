 * The v3 template layer (see `docs/design/pattern-machine-plan.md`, decision
 * 8 and "Phase 2: Config + templates"). Renders a state's content string
 * (`script`/`prompt`/`message`/`commit`, already auto-inlined by
 * `./PatternConfig.js`) as an Eta template over the agreed variable set.
 *
 * PURE-ISH BY DESIGN: this module owns only the Eta wiring. Every impure
 * value — the commit hashes, the diffs, and the `read` filesystem callback —
 * is INJECTED by the caller via `TemplateContext`. A later edge phase (Phase
 * 3) is responsible for actually computing `processDiff`/`lastDiff`, walking
 * git for the hashes, and wiring a real `read` that hits the working tree;
 * this module never touches git or the filesystem itself.
 *
 * Render errors (a malformed template, `read()` throwing for a missing
 * path, etc) are NOT caught here — they propagate as thrown errors, exactly as
 * the plan requires ("a failed commit-template render refuses the step").
