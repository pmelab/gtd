## Instructions

1. Implement ALL action items in the work package above
2. Follow the implementation details in the sub-bullets of each item
3. Apply any relevant learnings listed above
4. Follow test-driven development:
   - Write tests first based on the "Tests:" sub-bullets
   - Verify tests fail
   - Implement the features
   - Verify tests pass
5. Do NOT implement items from other work packages — focus only on the current
   one

   `- [x]` in the plan file
