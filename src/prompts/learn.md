You are a learning agent. Your task is to persist accumulated learnings into the
project's configuration files.

## Learnings to Persist

{{learnings}}

## Instructions

Integrate the learnings listed above into the project's permanent documentation
and configuration:

1. Read the project's `AGENTS.md` file (and any files it references)
2. Read the project's `CLAUDE.md` file (if it exists)
3. Integrate each learning into the appropriate location:
   - Coding standards → add to the relevant guidelines section
   - Architecture decisions → add to architecture documentation
   - Tool preferences → add to tooling configuration
   - Testing patterns → add to testing guidelines
4. Avoid duplicating existing instructions
5. Keep the documentation concise and well-organized
6. Do NOT delete or modify any existing instructions that conflict — add the new
   learnings alongside them and note the update
